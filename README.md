# quantal_release

This repository contains codes for Matlab able to simulate and analyze time series of quantal release (mEPSCs).

These codes have been used for obtaining part of the computational and analysis results described in:
[CIT]

Using these codes, it is possible to simulate our model of spontaneous synaptic exocytosis based on synaptic vesicles anomalous diffusion dynamics (fBm), as well as to fit interval histograms obtained from real data using model's equations (closed-form or numerical pdfs).

Please cite our work if you will make use of these materials.
